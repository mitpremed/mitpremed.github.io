                        <p>Rhoda Tano-Menka is currently a research technician in the Gaiha Lab of the Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard. She works on a team aiming to develop a viral escape mutation-resistant vaccine by developing therapies targeting structurally constrained viral regions crucial to viral fitness. She received her BA cum laude with honors in chemistry from Wellesley College, where she was awarded membership in the Sigma Xi research honors society after successfully completing and defending a senior honors thesis that explored the role of protective HLA-B*57 amino acid residues associated with HIV control to elucidate the divergent clinical outcomes of HIV Infection.
In the fall of 2022, Rhoda will begin an MD degree at the Yale, Stanford, or Dartmouth medical school. Although she is undecided about her future specialty, she plans to keep pursuing her passion for research. She ultimately aims to become a physician-scientist to help solve critical unmet needs in medicine, particularly in the field of infectious disease immunology.

Rhoda was born and raised in Ghana. Having grown up in a country with a limited healthcare infrastructure, she is committed to global health and equity in healthcare. In  January 2021, she co-founded R&G salad bar and more, a healthy food restaurant dedicated to alleviating the rise in cardiovascular and related diseases brought on by the mass influx of fast-food restaurants into the country.
In her free time, Rhoda loves to dance, cook meals from different parts of the world, and watch old sitcoms from the 80s, 90s, and early 2000s.
